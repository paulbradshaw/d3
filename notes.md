## Using CSS selectors

`d3.select("p").text("hello")` will select the *first* `p` tag and fill the text specified.

`d3.selectAll("p").text("hello")` will select *all* `p` tags and fill the text specified.

`tr:nth-child(1)` would select the first `tr` item - note it's a 1-based index for selectors.
